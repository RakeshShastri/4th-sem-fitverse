  </div>
  <div class="container">
      <p>As you can tell from the name, <b>High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) </b>is challenging. It takes your cardio workout to another level, as you push your pace out of your comfort zone.
        You can use HIIT with any type of cardio workout, whether it's running, using a stair climbing machine, rowing, or jumping rope.
        You&#39ll work up a sweat fast, working at a very intense level and then backing off for a slower recovery period, followed by another round of high intensity.
        That strategy can save you time: You don't have to work out as long as you would if you were keeping a <b>steady pace</b>.<br>
        You&#39ll lose weight, build muscle, and boost your metabolism. Plus there&#39s a post-workout bonus: Your body will burn calories for about 2 hours after you exercise
        You&#39ll work harder than you do when you do a typical cardio workout. But you&#39ll do it in spurts of 30 seconds to 3 minutes. Then you&#39ll have a chance to recover for about the same amount of time or longer.
        If you exercise regularly, HITT is a great alternative to your routine. Plus, this <b>High Intensity workout</b> really gets the <b>feel-good endorphins flowing</b>.

<div class="container">
    <p><b>Weight training</b> is a common type of strength training for developing the <b>strength and size of skeletal muscles</b>. It uses the force of gravity in the form of weighted bars, dumbbells or weight stacks in order to oppose the force generated by muscle through concentric or eccentric contraction. Weight training uses a variety of specialized equipment to target specific muscle groups and types of movement.
        Sports in which weight training is used include bodybuilding, weightlifting, powerlifting, strongman, highland games, hammer throw, shot put, discus throw, and javelin throw.<br> Many other sports use strength training as part of their training regimen, notably: American football, baseball, basketball, canoeing, cricket, football, hockey, lacrosse, mixed martial arts, rowing, rugby league, rugby union, track and field, boxing and wrestling.
        The basic principles of weight training are essentially identical to those of strength training, and involve a manipulation of the number of repetitions (reps), sets, tempo, exercise types, and weight moved<b> to cause desired increases in strength, endurance, and size</b>. The specific combinations of reps, sets, exercises, and weights depends on the aims of the individual performing the exercise.

<div class="container">
    <p><b>Yoga</b> is a group of <b>physical, mental, and spiritual practices</b> or disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke) and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness untouched by the mind (Citta) and mundane suffering (Duḥkha). There is a wide variety of schools of yoga, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism and traditional and modern yoga is practiced worldwide.<br>
        Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga. The linear model holds that yoga has Aryan origins, as reflected in the Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; according to author Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu scholars. According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of indigenous, non-Aryan practices and Aryan elements; this model is favoured in <b>Western scholarship</b>.

<div class="container">
    <p><b>Calisthenics</b> are exercises that don&#39t rely on anything but a person&#39s own body weight. These exercises are performed with <b>differing levels of intensity and rhythm</b>. Sometimes these exercises are done with light handheld tools like rings and wands.
        These exercises allow for the development of <b>strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination</b>.
        Calisthenics were developed in ancient Greece and became popular again in the early 19th century. <br>Today, fitness training of athletes, military personnel, law enforcement officers, and people trying to keep in shape use these exercises for warming up for strenuous sports or to help build up their bodies. Scientist are also now studying the use of calisthenics to help treat various health conditions, from obesity to COPD
        The most commonly performed calisthenic exercises include <b>Push-Ups, Sit-Ups, Squats, Dips, Chin-Ups, Handstands</b>, etc.

<div class="container">
    <p>It&#39s not only <b>six-pack seekers</b> who should be paying their abs plenty of attention when they visit the gym. Strong abs are an integral part of a <b>rock-solid core</b>, which should be one of the goals of any fitness regime.
        That&#39s because a strong core is the foundation upon which so many other things rest  whether that&#39s <b>good posture</b> that helps to <b>prevent lower back pain</b> developing from sitting at a desk all day, or the mobility and strength required to excel in sports and other activities ranging all the way from athletics to zumba.
        <br>Forming a mighty midriff will also help you perform better when doing all manner of other moves in the gym. Powerhouse lifts like barbell squats and deadlifts all <b>demand a strong core</b>, as do agility workouts and plyometric exercises.
        So the list of benefits of adding abs exercises to your gym repertoire and strengthening your core is almost endless.
        Some Beginner Abs Exercises include: <b>Plank, Reverse Crunch, Grouded Russian Twist, Handwalk, Abs Rollout,<b> etc.
